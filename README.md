# *AR-Fit: Transforming Spaces, Transforming Lives*  
*Your AR Fitness Companion Anytime, Anywhere!*

---

## *Overview*
AR-Fit is an augmented reality fitness app designed to make workouts accessible, engaging, and effective for everyone, especially underserved communities. By leveraging AR technology, the app offers real-time guidance, gamification, and personalized routines to tackle modern health challenges like stress, obesity, and posture-related issues.

## *Inspiration*
The lack of accessible fitness resources in rural and low-income communities inspired AR-Fit. With limited access to gyms, trainers, or proper guidance, individuals often face preventable health issues. AR-Fit bridges this gap by turning any space into a personal workout zone, making fitness affordable and inclusive.
